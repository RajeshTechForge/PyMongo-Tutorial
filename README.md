# MongoDB Introduction (:
**MongoDB** is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a _NoSQL database_ program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and current versions are licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL) which is considered non-free by some organizations and distributions. MongoDB is a member of the MACH Alliance. 

**Key Features**🎉 :
- **Document-oriented database:** Stores data in flexible JSON-like documents that can evolve.
- **NoSQL:** Offers schema flexibility compared to traditional relational databases.
- **Widely used:** Popular choice for modern applications due to its scalability and performance.
