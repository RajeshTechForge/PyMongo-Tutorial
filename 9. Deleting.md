# Deleting Document

For deleting document also there are two functions:  
1. `delete_one()` -----> for deleting one document
2. `delete_many()` ----> for deleting multiple documents

Again, first connect to client and then,

## > delete_one
```python
_filter = {"name":"A"}  # filter
collection.delete_one(_filter)  # deleting
```

## > delete_many
It deletes all documents that match the filter.
```python
filter_2 = {"Platform": "Git"}  # filter
dle = collection.delete_many(filter_2)  # deleting
```

For counting number of documents deleted
```python
print(dle.deleted_count)
```
