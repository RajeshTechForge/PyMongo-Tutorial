# Find Document In Database

PyMongo have function called `find_one()` to find any document in the database. `find_one()` returns only **one** document. It doesn't have any function to find multiple documents at the same time. You have to use **for loop** for it.

Again first connect to the client, select database and collection

```python
import pymongo

# Connecting client
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017")

db = client['test-database']  # database
collection = db['test-collection']  # database
```
### > Now for Finding Document

1. Finding random document
    ```python
    doc = collection.find_one()
    print(doc)
    ```

2. **Finding Specific document**
    ```python
    _filter = {'name':'A'}  # filter
    doc = collection.find_one(_filter)
    print(doc)
    ```

### > Counting the no. of documents of matching the filter

```python
_filter = {"language": "Python"}
# counting the number of document/s of matching the filter
count = collection.count_documents(_filter)
print(count)
```
