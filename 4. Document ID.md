# Document ID

MongoDB sets a _document id_ for every document by itself in the database to manage them. But you can also give your custom document id (But it should be unique). To do so just add **'_id'** key and its **value** in the dictionary ( `{ '_id':'CustomID' }` ). Like:

```python
my_dict = {
    "_id":"customID",
    "name":"D", 
    "language": "Javascript", 
    "Platform": "Git"
    }

# NOTE: "_id":"customID"
```

Now we can just insert it into the collection as mentioned earlier.
