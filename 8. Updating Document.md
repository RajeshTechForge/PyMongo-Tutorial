# Updating Document

When we are working with database then, we have to update documents with time. Here we can do that using PyMongo.  
**Pymongo have functions that updates document,**  
1. `update_one()`,
2. `update_many()`

_Here also we have to arrange updated valuesi into dictionary_ But here you have to put this dictionary into another dictionary of key `"$set"`. Like: `{"$set": {"key": "updated value"}}`  

After connecting to client,
<br>

## > update_one

Example:
```python
# Changing A's language to Python (Previously it was Java)
filter = {"name": "A"}  # creating a filter
updated_values = {"$set":{"language": "Python"}}

collection.update_one(filter, updated_values)  # Updating
```

## > update_many
**It changes every documents value which matches the filter** 
Example: 
```python
# Changing everyone's language to Python, whose Platform is GitHub

_filter = {"Platform": "GitHub"}  # filter
updated_values = {"$set":{"age":18}}

up = collection.update_many(_filter, updated_values)  # Updating
```
For counting the number of documents updated
```python
print(up.modified_count)
```
