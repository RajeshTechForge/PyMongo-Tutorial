# Showing Databases and Collections

Anytime we may need to check the list of created databases and collections. Luckily, PyMongo have functionality to do it.  

For this,  
First connect to the client,
```python
import pymongo

# Connecting client
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017")
```

### > Databases
```python
# For listing all Databases
AllDatabases = client.list_database_names()
print(AllDatabases)
```

### > Collections

First select the _database_ and then,
```python
db = client['test-database']  # selected database

# For listing all collections
AllCollections = db.list_collection_names()
print(AllCollections)
```
