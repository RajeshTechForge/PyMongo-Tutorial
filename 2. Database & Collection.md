# Database & Collection

The way to **Creating** and **Opening** existing _Database_ and _Collection_ are same. If the given databese or collection name matched with an existing one then it will open it. Otherwise it will create a new database with the same name.  
<br>
But still there are slightly difference.  
<br>
If you are creating a new database or collection then _you have to insert a document into them_. Otherwise database or collection wil not create.

```python
# importing
from pymongo import MongoClient

# Connecting client
client = MongoClient('localhost', 27017)
```

### > Database

```python
# for opening or creating database
db = client['test-database']
```

### > Collection

```python
# for opening or creating collection
collection = db['test-collection']
```
**NOTE :** You have to give collection name in the defined database; here 'db'  
<br>
### > Inserting

Now you have to insert a document into the collection if you are creating a new one as mentioned before,

```python
# first arrange the values into a dictionary
my_dict = {"name": "HONEY", "language": "Python", "Platform": "GitHub"}
```
Here I am using 'insert_one' function to insert the values. Another function to insert the value I will explain in next step.

```python
# insert the value containing dictionary
collection.insert_one(my_dict)  # Using "insert_one" function
```
