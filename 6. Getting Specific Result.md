# Getting Specific Result

When we import data from database then we may want to get only required data, not all data from documents. For that we have to show only required data and have to hind other things. We can do this by using PyMongo.  

**If we want to hind some Key's value, then we can do this just by adding a second argument contains keys in a dictionary.**  
**There, key's value will be `0` or `1`**  
`0 ----> it not will print`  
`1 ----> it will print`  

_If we make the specific key or keys `1`, then others key automately become `0` ( **BUT not `_id` key** )_

**Example:**

```python
import pymongo

# Connecting client
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017")
db = client['test-database']  # Database
collection = db['test-collection']  # Collection


# Finding Specific document using filter
_filter = {'name':'A'}

# Showing only specific keys
one = collection.find_one(_filter, {'name':1})
# NOTE: here only '_id' & 'name' key will show

two = collection.find_one(_filter, {'name':1, '_id':0})
# here only 'name' will show

print(one)
print(two)
```

From the above example we can see that we have to make `_id` key 0. Because it doesn't become `0` by default.
